PROJECT:

The most anoying box in the world! Using a car horn, Mosfet, 9V, arduino and a LDR I created a light sensictive box that would
et the car horn off when you would open it. This project was created so I could send this box to freinds over the mail, have them
open it and get a lovely reaction.

CODE:

int Testpin = 3; //somebs
int LDR_Pin = A0; //analog pin 0

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop(){
  int LDRReading = analogRead(LDR_Pin); 

  
  //If statement, If its dark the resistanve will be higher than 950. If light, resitance will be lower.
  
  if (LDRReading < 950) {
   analogWrite(Testpin, HIGH); 
} else {
  analogWrite(Testpin, LOW);
}


Serial.println(LDRReading);
}



HOW:

LDR- Light Dependent Resistor.
Arudnio-Microcontroller 
Car Horn- Appriatice that is normaly connected to a vehicial that emits a loud sound 60DB+ It is normaly 12Volts

Process/dbug:
Using the aurduino libary I mesured the resistance relitvae to light how can we process the data from LDR
Analog input. Changed. values all good. resitance high when dark, Low when light.

Add if statement in code,  
if (LDRReading < 950) {
   analogWrite(Testpin, HIGH); 
} else {
  analogWrite(Testpin, LOW);
}

Mosfet time.. Gate Control Dump
Why the F wont it work with Digital? digital is on and off? so sending a high to the gate should open the mosfet... 
Changed value after hours to Analog, then finally would the gate, open and allow flow out of Dump. 

Two 9Volts in series. Gave like 19Volts to the horn. LOUD. 
Dont use hands in acetone. Ferrofluid is comming!
